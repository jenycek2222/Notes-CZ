The other day I was thinking, who would watch all the cool and trendy ChatGPT videos, if the OpenAI made it paid and the ChatGPT would fall into the darkness of oblivion (zapomnění). My honest guess is that people would not watch these videos and the algorithm would stop recommending them, efectively killing the trend. Then a couple of years later, new people in the field would not know, what that trend was and that would be fine, because they would not bump into these videos that used to be trendy. Unless someone would browse through all the videos of a techy channel and discovered this unrecommended history archive of no more trendy videos. As I often browse through videos of specific IT channels, I came to realise, that I am not seeing any old trendy videos, that are no longer trendy, which is wierd and paradoxical. Maybe one day, I will.  

Thought map:
New trendy tech gets born -> youtubers make videos about it -> the trendy tech is made not free anymore -> people stop using the trend -> people forget about the tech -> trendy videos are not being recommended anymore -> some random guy bumps into one of these videos and gets confused

Maybe it already happened to me, but I did not realise. I should listen to myself and think about this when I say I am late to the party.
