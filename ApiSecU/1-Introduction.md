## Welcome to API Penetration Testing!
- Welcome to notes from the API Pen-test certification from ApiSecU
- official cert name: ACE (APISec Certified Expert)
- in this course, we will hack some APIs from the keyboard perspective and not just theoretically
- vulnerabilities discussed in this course are: Broken Authentication, Mass Assignment, Broken Object-level authorization
- with this cert you will have the skills to thoroughly test Web based APIs
- this course is for everyone interested in APIs
- prerequisities: basic knowledge of APIs and how they work
- this course is free
- ACE Exam is a 6 hour long exam, which will get you the certification
